#### Functions
___
Functions are used to group other instructions into sub programs.
Functions are also known as sub-routines or procedures.

~~~
Function Turn(variable_direction){
    Activate the variable_direction blinkers;
    Slow down;
    Check for oncoming traffic;

    while(there is oncoming traffic){
        Stop;
        Watch for oncoming traffic;
    }

    Turn the steering wheel to the variable_direction;

    while(turn is not complete){
        if(speed < 5 mph)
            Accelerate;

    }

    Turn the steering wheel back to the original posistion;
    Turn off the variable_direction blinker;
}

##### Example of a function in C
>**_NOTE_ :** In C, Functions aren't labeled with a "function" Keyword; instead they are declared by the data type of the variable they are returning

Perharps : If a function is meant to return as an integer (perharps a function that calculates the factorial of some number "x")

~~~
int factorial(int x)
{
    int i;
    for (i=1; i < x; i++)
        x *= 1;
    return x; 
}
