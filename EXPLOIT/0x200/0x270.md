#### Memory Segmentation
> A Compiled program's memory is divided into five segments:
- text
- data
- bss
- heap
- stack

> The **text segment** is often called the code segment. This is where the assembled machine language instructions of the program are located.

> The **data and bss** segments are used to store global and static program variables. The **data** segment is filled with initialized global and static variables, while the **bss** segment is filled with their unintialized counterparts.

> The **heap** is a segment of the memory in which a programmer can directly control. The **heap** will grow and shrink depending on how much memory is reserved for use.

> The **stack** segment also has a variable size and is used as a temporary scatch pad to store local function variables and context during function calls.When an item is placed into a stack, it's known as **pushing**, and when and item is removed from a stack it is known as **popping**.
The stack follows the principle of FILO(**First-In, Last-Out**)

**esp** -> Is the Top of a stack.(Stack pointer)
___
**ebp** -> ebp is usually set to esp at the start of the function. Function parameters and local variables are accessed by adding and subtracting, respectively, a constant offset from ebp. All x86 calling conventions define ebp as being preserved across function calls. ebp itself actually points to the previous frame's base pointer, which enables stack walking in a debugger and viewing other frame's local variables to work.

**ebp** -> Frame Pointer.
___
**eip** -> Execution Pointer.
___
**sfp** -> Saved Frame Pointer
