#### File Access
****
There are two primary ways to access files in C:
<br>

- File Descriptors
- File Streams

****
**File Descriptors**: use set of low-level I/O functions. A file descriptor is a number that is used to reference open files.

- open( )
- close( )
- read( )
- write( )

****


**File Streams**: use set of higher-level form of buffered I/O that is built on the lower-level functions.

- O_RDONLY : Open File for read-only access.
- O_WRONLY : Open File for write-only access.
- O_RDWR : Open File for both read and write access.
- O_APPEND : Write data at the end of the file.
- O_TRUNC : If the file already exist, truncate the file to 0 length.
- O_CREAT : Create the File if it doesn't exist
