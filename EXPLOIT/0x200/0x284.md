#### Structs
Structs are variables that can contain many other variables.
\
Example:-> When dealing with some many time functions, these functions use a
time struct called **tm**\
which is defined in **/usr/include/time.h**

``` C
struct tm {
    int tm_sec;             //Seconds
    int tm_min;             //Minutes
    int tm_hour;            //Hours
    int tm_mday;            //Day of the Month
    int tm_year;            //year
    int tm_wday;            //day of the weak
    int tm_yday;            //day of the year
    int tm_isdst;           //dayligth saving time
}
```

\
The Struct **tm** becomes a usable variable type.
