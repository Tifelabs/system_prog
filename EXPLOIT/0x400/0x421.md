#### Socket Functions

Sockets behaves like files since they use file descriptors to identify themselves.

sockets functions are defined in: `/usr/include/sys/sockets.h`

---

```c
socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
```

 Used to create a new socket, returns a file descriptor for the socket or -1 on error.

---

```c
connect(int fd, struct sockaddr *remote_host, socklen_t addr_length);
```

Connects a socket (describe by the file descriptor fd) to remote host. Returns 0 on success and -1 on error.

---

```c
bind(int fd, struct sock_addr *local_addr, socklen_t addr_length);
```

Binds a socket to a local address so it can listen for incomming connections.
Returns 0 on success and -1 on error.

---

```c
listen(int fd, int backlog_queue_size);
```

Listens for incoming connections and queues connection request up to backlog_queue_size.
Returns 0 on success and -1 on error.
