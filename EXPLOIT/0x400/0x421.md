#### Socket Functions

Sockets behaves like files since they use file descriptors to identify themselves.

sockets functions are defined in: `/usr/include/sys/sockets.h`

---

```c
socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
```

 Used to create a new socket, returns a file descriptor for the socket or -1 on error.

---

```c
connect(int fd, struct sockaddr *remote_host, socklen_t addr_length);
```

Connects a socket (describe by the file descriptor fd) to remote host. Returns 0 on success and -1 on error.

---

```c
bind(int fd, struct sock_addr *local_addr, socklen_t addr_length);
```

Binds a socket to a local address so it can listen for incomming connections.
Returns 0 on success and -1 on error.

---

```c
listen(int fd, int backlog_queue_size);
```

Listens for incoming connections and queues connection request up to backlog_queue_size.
Returns 0 on success and -1 on error.

---

```c
accept(int fd, sockaddr *remote_host, socklen_t *addr_length);
```

Accepts an incoming connction on bound socket. Th eaddress information from the remote host is written into
the remote_host structure and the actual size of the address is written into *addr_lenght. This function
returns a new socket file descriptor to identify the connected socket or -1 on error.

---

```c
send(int fd, void *buffer, size_t n, int flags);
```

Sends n bytes from *buffer to socket fd; returns the number of bytes sent or -1 on error.

---

```c
recv(int fd, void *buffer, size_t n, int flags);
```

Receives n bytes from socket fd into *buffer; returns the number of bytes received or -1 on error.
