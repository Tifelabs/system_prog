##### Algorithmic Run Time

> Algorithmic run time is the time complexity is the computational 
> complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm.

```txt
    for(i = 1 to n){
       Do something;
       Do something; 
    }
    Do one last things;
```

> The algorithm loops n times doing two actions, and then does one last action,
> so the time complexity for this algorithm would be $$2n + 1$$

> A more complex algorithm with an additional
> nested loop tacked on, showned below, would have
> a time complexity of $$n^2 + 2n + 1 $$
> since the new action is executed $$n^2$$

```txt
    for(x = 1 to n){
        for(y = 1 to n){
            Do the new action;
        }
    }
    for(i = 1 to n){
        Do Something;
        Do another thing;
    }
    Do one last thing;
```
