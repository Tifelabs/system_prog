#### RSA
___

RSA is an asymmetric algorithm, its security is based on difficulty of factoring large numbers.
First, two prime numbers are chosen, ***P and Q***, and their product, ***N***, is computed:

$$N = P \cdot Q$$

The numbers between ***1 and N - 1*** that are relatively prime to NN must be calculated (two numbers are relatively prime if their common divisor is 1). This is known as ***Euler's Totient Function*** annd it is denoted by $$\phi(n)$$

#### Example
$$\phi(9) = 6$$
Since ***1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8*** are relatively prime to **9**

More >> $$\phi(P \cdot Q) = (P - 1) \cdot (Q - 1)$$

>[!NOTE]
> The ***EUCLIDEAN ALGORITHM*** is a fast way to calculate the ***GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR (GCD)*** of two numbers.

#### GCD Calculation

| A    | B   | R  |
| ---- | ----|--- |
| 7253 | 120 | 53 |
| 120  | 53  | 14 |
| 53   | 14  | 11 |
| 14   | 11  |  3 |
| 11   | 3   |  2 |
| 3    | 2   |  1 |
| 2    | 1   |  0 |

$$\therefore \text{The greatest common divisor of 7243 and 120 is 1. That means 7243 and 120 are relatively prime to each other.}$$

#### Extended Algorithm

$$\text{The extended Euclidean Algorithm deals with finding two integers, } J \text{ and } K \text{ such that } J \cdot A + K \cdot B = R$$

$$\text{when gcd} (A,B) = R$$
