//Signed, Unsigned, Long, and Short

//NOTE: By default the numerical values in C are signed
// Meaning they can be both negative and positive..

//UNSIGNED values don't allow negative numerical values
//Since it is all just memory end.

//NOTE all  numerical values must be stored in binaries
//and unsigned values make the most sense in binary.
