#### Memory Segmentation
> A Compiled program's memory is divided into five segments:
- text
- data
- bss
- heap
- stack

> The **text segment** is often called the code segment. This is where the assembled machine language instructions of the program are located.

> The **data and bss** segments are used to store global and static program variables. The **data** segment is filled with initialized global and static variables, while the **bss** segment is filled with their unintialized counterparts.

> The **heap** is a segment of the memory in which a programmer can directly control. The **heap** will grow and shrink depending on how much memory is reserved for use.

> The **stack** segment also has a variable size and is used as a temporary scatch pad to store local function variables and context during function calls.When an item is placed into a stack, it's known as **pushing**, and when and item is removed from a stack it is known as **popping**.
The stack follows the principle of FILO(**First-In, Last-Out**)
