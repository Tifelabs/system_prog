#### Memory Segment

The compiled code goes into the test segement, while the variables reside in the remaining segments.

The Static keyword can also be used to prepend any variable declaration and 
make the variable static.

When **Static or Global** Variables are initialized with data, they are stored in the **data** memory segment, otherwise they are stored in the **bss** memory segment.
