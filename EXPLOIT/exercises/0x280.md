#### File Access
****
There are two primary ways to access files in C:
<br>
- File Descriptors
- File Streams
****
**File Descriptors**: use set of low-level I/O functions. A file descriptor is a number that is used to reference open files.
- open( )
- close( )
- read( )
- write( )
****


**File Streams**: use set of higher-level form of buffered I/O that is built on the lower-level functions.
