/* 

Problem Statement:

Write a C program that does the following:

    Declare an integer array of size 5 and initialize it with some values (e.g., {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}).

    Declare a pointer to the array.

    Use the pointer to:

        Print the address and value of each element in the array.

        Calculate the sum of all elements in the array.

        Find the maximum value in the array.

    Print the results.

    // Declaring the integer pointer
    int *pointer_array;

    // Assigning the pointer to the array
    pointer_array = int_array;

    // Variables for sum and max
    int sum = 0;
    int max = *pointer_array; // Initialize max with the first element

    // Looping through the integer array
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        // Print the address and value of the current element
